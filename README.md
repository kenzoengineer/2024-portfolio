# Ken Jiang's Portfolio Website [2024]

A new year means a new website. This year I decided to go with a design inspired by [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus).

All tiles are procedurally generated, and change upon refresh.

(Unfortunately they also change on page resize, but the effort required to prevent this is high)

Devin, please don't take our jobs!
